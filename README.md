[Tensorflow] Feature Representation Learning for Robust Retinal Disease Detection from Optical Coherence Tomography Images

This code is for our paper "RV-GAN: Segmenting Retinal Vascular Structure inFundus Photographs using a Novel Multi-scaleGenerative Adversarial Network" which is part of the supplementary materials for MICCAI 2021 conference. The paper has since been accpeted and presented at MICCAI 2021.
